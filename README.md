Repository for the assignment from company Quintor. The team is to do the finance application for Sports Clubs. 
Its role is to manage bank transfers for the members and facilities.
This project would be made with help of the databases and APIs, thus making data processing easier.

## Coding Conventions
This part will clarify the structure and naming norms that code needs to match

### Naming
Our code uses camelCase for the method and variable naming. Classes are the only exception using capital letters at the start.

    class Exampleclass{}
    public void exampleMethod(){}
    private boolean isValid;

### Commenting
Commenting the code is mandatory. This is to ensure readability and scalability. Should be done in a logical, short phrases.


### Indenting
Single indenting should look like this:

    if(statement){
        code;
    }

Nested indenting should look like this:

    for(object var1 in list){
        for(object var2 in list){
            code;
        }
    }

### Working on code
When the code is not readable or agreeable, doesn't follow the conventions or raises questions, then the code change can be requested and needs to be approved by the orginal author.
